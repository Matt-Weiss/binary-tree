# binary-tree
Week 2 challenge

I had a rough start to this challenge, I don't think I had any usable code for the first half hour. This was my first introduction to binary trees and I struggled with visualizing the traversal process. 

Even though we were told we didn't have to write tests, I only made progress once I did start writing tests.

I feel like with another half hour, I would have made much more progress.
